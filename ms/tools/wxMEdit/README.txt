      http://www.bakefile.org/download.html

Syntax files, Locale files and Settings:
---------------------------------------
  Syntax files: in the path $(wxMEditConfigPath)/syntax/
  Locale files: in the path $(wxMEditConfigPath)/locale/
  
  $(wxMEditConfigPath) are the one of below paths:
    1. wxMEdit execution file directory under Windows and Unix-like OS.
    2. $(HOME)/.wxmedit/ under Unix-like OS.
    3. $(PREFIX)/share/wxmedit/ under Unix-like OS.
    4. %APPDATA%\wxmedit\ under Windows accroding to settings.
  
  If wxMEdit does not find any files in those paths, 
  wxMEdit can also execute standalone by using default settings.
  
  When quit wxMEdit, wxMEdit will save the settings to:
    1. $(HOME)/.wxmedit/wxmedit.cfg under Unix-like OS.
    2. %APPDATA%\wxmedit\ or $(wxMEdit execution file directory)/wxmedit.cfg under Windows accroding to settings.
  And FontWidth.dat will also be saved to the same path.
  FontWidth.dat is Cache of Font-Width-Data, it can speed-up wxMEdit a lot.
